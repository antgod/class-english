Grab is Southeast Asia (SEA)'s leading transportation platform and our mission is to drive SEA forward, leveraging on the latest technology and the talented people we have in the company. As of May 2017, we handle 2.3 million rides daily and we are growing and hiring at a rapid scale.

grab是领导东南亚的运输平台。借助我们公司最新的技术和人才。在2017年五月，我们日均处理2.3百万订单并且保持快速规模性招聘人才。

To keep up with Grab's phenomenal growth, our web team and web platforms have to grow as well. Fortunately, or unfortunately, at Grab, the web team has been keeping up with the latest best practices and has incorporated the modern JavaScript ecosystem in our web apps.

为了保持grab(业务)飞快的增长速度，我们的前端团队和前端平台成长良好。幸运的或者不幸的是，我们的前端团队在我们的App中保持最新的最佳实践与包含javascript流行生态系统。

The result of this is that our new hires or back end engineers, who are not necessarily well-acquainted with the modern JavaScript ecosystem, may feel overwhelmed by the barrage of new things that they have to learn just to complete their feature or bug fix in a web app. Front end development has never been so complex and exciting as it is today. New tools, libraries, frameworks and plugins emerge every other day and there is so much to learn. It is imperative that newcomers to the web team are guided to embrace this evolution of the front end, learn to navigate the ecosystem with ease, and get productive in shipping code to our users as fast as possible. We have come up with a study guide to introduce why we do what we do, and how we handle front end at scale.

结果是我们新招来的（前端）人员或者后端工程师，并不需要非常熟悉流行的前端生态系统。在他们在app中完成他们的工作以及修复bug的时候，他们会受到密集的学习新知识而受到打击。前端开发从没有像如今一样复杂并且令人兴奋。新的工具，库和框架、插件每天都会浮现并且需要大量时间去学习。这需要新的web团队开发者拥抱变化，通过例子学习生态系统的导航。并且尽快产出可生产的代码。我们想出一个学习指南介绍我们做了什么并且怎么做的，以及如何处理大规模前端。

This study guide is inspired by "A Study Plan to Cure JavaScript Fatigue" and is mildly opinionated in the sense that we recommend certain libraries/frameworks to learn for each aspect of front end development, based on what is currently deemed most suitable at Grab. We explain why a certain library/framework/tool is chosen and provide links to learning resources to enable the reader to pick it up on their own. Alternative choices that may be better for other use cases are provided as well for reference and further self-exploration.

指南的灵感来源于“治愈js疲劳学习计划”，有点固执己见的认为根据目前 最适合grab，我们推荐某一个库/框架。解释了为什么我们推荐这个库并且提供学习资源链接让读者能自由选择与拥有他们。二选其一的选择能让我们更好的适应其他用例提供应用并且未来的自我学习。

If you are familiar with front end development and have been consistently keeping up with the latest developments, this guide will probably not be that useful to you. It is targeted at newcomers to front end.

如果你一贯的保持使用最新的技术，那么这个指南对你没有用处。这个指南为了新手。

If your company is exploring a modern JavaScript stack as well, you may find this study plan useful to your company too! Feel free to adapt it to your needs. We will update this study plan periodically, according to our latest work and choices.

如果你的公司探索流行前端技术栈比较好，你将会发现这个学习计划对你们公司很有用。随着您的需要，我们会经常更新这个学习计划，根据我们最近的工作与选择。
