Every file is generated based on the corresponding .md file in the doc/api/ folder in Node.js's source tree. The documentation is generated using the tools/doc/generate.js program. An HTML template is located at doc/template.html.

Stability Index#
Throughout the documentation are indications of a section's stability. The Node.js API is still somewhat changing, and as it matures, certain parts are more reliable than others. Some are so proven, and so relied upon, that they are unlikely to ever change at all. Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous and in the process of being redesigned.

The stability indices are as follows:

Stability: 0 - Deprecated. This feature is known to be problematic, and changes may be planned. Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings to be emitted. Backwards compatibility across major versions should not be expected.
Stability: 1 - Experimental. This feature is still under active development and subject to non-backwards compatible changes, or even removal, in any future version. Use of the feature is not recommended in production environments. Experimental features are not subject to the Node.js Semantic Versioning model.
Stability: 2 - Stable. The API has proven satisfactory. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem is a high priority, and will not be broken unless absolutely necessary.
Caution must be used when making use of Experimental features, particularly within modules that may be used as dependencies (or dependencies of dependencies) within a Node.js application. End users may not be aware that experimental features are being used, and therefore may experience unexpected failures or behavior changes when API modifications occur. To help avoid such surprises, Experimental features may require a command-line flag to explicitly enable them, or may cause a process warning to be emitted. By default, such warnings are printed to stderr and may be handled by attaching a listener to the 'warning' event.

JSON Output#
Added in: v0.6.12
Stability: 1 - Experimental
Every .html document has a corresponding .json document presenting the same information in a structured manner. This feature is experimental, and added for the benefit of IDEs and other utilities that wish to do programmatic things with the documentation.

Syscalls and man pages#
System calls like open(2) and read(2) define the interface between user programs and the underlying operating system. Node.js functions which simply wrap a syscall, like fs.open(), will document that. The docs link to the corresponding man pages (short for manual pages) which describe how the syscalls work.

Most Unix syscalls have Windows equivalents, but behavior may differ on Windows relative to Linux and macOS. For an example of the subtle ways in which it's sometimes impossible to replace Unix syscall semantics on Windows, see Node issue 4760.

Usage#
node [options] [V8 options] [script.js | -e "script" | - ] [arguments]

Please see the Command Line Options document for information about different options and ways to run scripts with Node.js.

Example#
An example of a web server written with Node.js which responds with 'Hello World!':

Commands displayed in this document are shown starting with $ or > to replicate how they would appear in a user's terminal. Do not include the $ and > character they are there to indicate the start of each command.

There are many tutorials and examples that follow this convention: $ or > for commands run as a regular user, and # for commands that should be executed as an administrator.

Lines that don’t start with $ or > character are typically showing the output of the previous command.

Firstly, make sure to have downloaded and installed Node.js. See this guide for further install information.

Now, create an empty project folder called projects, navigate into it: Project folder can be named base on user's current project title but this example will use projects as the project folder.

Linux and Mac:

$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
Windows CMD:

> mkdir %USERPROFILE%\projects
> cd %USERPROFILE%\projects
Windows PowerShell:

> mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\projects
> cd $env:USERPROFILE\projects
Next, create a new source file in the projects folder and call it hello-world.js.

In Node.js it is considered good style to use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to separate multiple words in filenames.

Open hello-world.js in any preferred text editor and paste in the following content.

const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
Save the file, go back to the terminal window enter the following command:

$ node hello-world.js
An output like this should appear in the terminal to indicate Node.js server is running:

Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
Now, open any preferred web browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:3000.

If the browser displays the string Hello, world!, that indicates the server is working.

Many of the examples in the documentation can be run similarly.
